`ULG.nvim` is a log viewer designed to integrate Unreal Engine's log flow directly into Neovim.
It also supports displaying Unreal Insights data, allowing you to check the performance of each frame with a sparkline. Furthermore, by using ['neo-tree-unl'](https://github.com/taku25/neo-tree-unl), you can jump directly to functions from the Insights information.

Built upon the [`UNL.nvim`](https://github.com/taku25/UNL.nvim) library, it offers real-time log tailing, powerful filtering capabilities, and the ability to jump to source code from log entries.

This plugin is part of a suite of tools designed to enhance Unreal Engine development, including ([`UEP.nvim`](https://github.com/taku25/UEP.nvim), [`UBT.nvim`](https://github.com/taku25/UBT.nvim), and [`UCM.nvim`](https://github.com/taku25/UCM.nvim)).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Log Tailing**: Monitors log files for changes and automatically displays new entries (`tail`).
*   **Build Log Integration**: Seamlessly works with [`UBT.nvim`](https://github.com/taku25/UBT.nvim) to display UE logs and build logs simultaneously in intelligently split windows. You can also jump from build errors.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhances readability by colorizing log levels like `Error`, `Warning`, as well as categories, timestamps, and file paths.
*   **Powerful Filtering**:
    *   Dynamic filtering with regular expressions.
    *   Multi-select filtering by log category.
        **Categories are collected in real-time for selection.**
    *   Toggle all filters on/off temporarily.
*   **Unreal Editor Integration (Remote Command Execution)**: Send commands like triggering Live Coding or `stat` commands directly to the Unreal Editor from the log window. (**Optional**)
*   **Insights (utrace) Support**: Analyzes `.utrace` files exported from Unreal Insights, allowing you to intuitively inspect performance loads.
    * With `neo-tree-unl`, you can jump directly to functions. (**Optional**)
*   **Jump to Source**: Instantly jump to the corresponding source code location from a file path in the logs (e.g., `C:/.../File.cpp(10:20)`) with a single key press (`<CR>`).
*   **Flexible UI**:
    *   Log windows can be opened in vertical or horizontal splits, with customizable positions and sizes.
    *   You can configure the parent-child relationship between the UE log and build log windows (which one is primary).
    *   Toggle timestamp visibility.
*   **Auto-Close Functionality**: Automatically closes the ULG windows and exits Neovim when the last non-log window is closed.
*   **Highly Customizable**: Almost every aspect, including keymaps and highlight groups, can be customized via the `setup` function.
*   **Statusline Integration**: Integrates with [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) to display an icon indicating that log monitoring is active. (**Optional**)

## üöÄ Installation

Install using your favorite plugin manager.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

`UNL.nvim` is a mandatory dependency. `lazy.nvim` will handle this automatically.

```lua
-- lua/plugins/ulg.lua

return {
  'taku25/ULG.nvim',
  -- ULG.nvim depends on UNL.nvim.
  -- UBT.nvim is also required for build log features.
  dependencies = { 'taku25/UNL.nvim', 'taku25/UBT.nvim' },
  opts = {
    -- Place your configuration here (see details below)
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the plugin's behavior by passing a table to the `setup()` function (or the `opts` table in `lazy.nvim`).
Below are all available options with their default values.

```lua
-- Inside the opts = { ... } table for ULG.nvim

{
  -- Settings for the main UE log window
  position = "bottom", -- "right", "left", "bottom", "top", "tab"
  size = 0.25,         -- Percentage of the screen height/width (0.0 to 1.0)

  -- Settings for the build log window
  build_log_enabled = true,
  -- Position of the build log:
  -- "secondary": Automatically placed in the remaining space relative to the UE log (Recommended)
  -- "primary": Places the build log where the UE log would normally go, and positions the UE log relatively
  -- "bottom", "top", "left", "right", "tab": Specifies an absolute position on the screen
  build_log_position = "secondary",
  build_log_size = 0.4, -- As a ratio to the UE log for "secondary"/"primary", or to the screen for absolute positions

  -- Automatically close ULG windows when the last non-log buffer is closed
  enable_auto_close = true,

  -- Filetype for the log buffer
  filetype = "unreal-log",

  -- Automatically scroll to the end when new logs are added
  auto_scroll = true,

  -- Interval to check for log file changes (in milliseconds)
  polling_interval_ms = 500,
  -- Maximum number of log lines to render at once
  render_chunk_size = 500,

  -- Hide timestamps by default
  hide_timestamp = true,

  keymaps = {
    -- Keymaps for the log window
    log = {
      filter_prompt = "s",          -- Input for regex filter
      filter_clear = "<Esc>",       -- Clear all filters
      toggle_timestamp = "i",       -- Toggle timestamp visibility
      clear_content = "c",          -- Clear log content
      category_filter_prompt = "f", -- Select category filter
      remote_command_prompt = "P",  -- Open remote command prompt
      jump_to_source = "<CR>",      -- Jump to source code
      filter_toggle = "t",          -- Toggle all filters on/off
      search_prompt = "p",          -- Search within the view (highlight)
      jump_next_match = "]f",       -- Jump to the next filtered line
      jump_prev_match = "[f",       -- Jump to the previous filtered line
      toggle_build_log = "b",       -- (Note: This keymap is not currently used by ULG)
      show_help = "?",              -- Show help window
    },

    -- Keymaps for the Trace Summary viewer
    trace = {
      show_callees_tree = "<cr>",
      show_callees = "c",          -- Show frame details in a floating window
      show_gantt_chart = "t",
      scroll_right_page = "L",     -- Scroll one page right
      scroll_left_page = "H",      -- Scroll one page left
      scroll_right = "l",          -- Scroll one frame right
      scroll_left = "h",           -- Scroll one frame left
      toggle_scale_mode = "m",     -- Toggle sparkline scale mode
      next_spike = "]",            -- Jump to the next spike
      prev_spike = "[",            -- Jump to the previous spike
      first_spike = "g[",          -- Jump to the first spike
      last_spike = "g]",           -- Jump to the last spike
      first_frame = "gg",          -- Jump to the first frame
      last_frame = "G",            -- Jump to the last frame
      show_help = "?",
    },
  },

  -- Border style for the help window
  help = {
    border = "rounded",
  },

  -- Characters for the trace sparkline
  spark_chars = { " ", "‚ñÇ", "‚ñÉ", "‚ñÑ", "‚ñÖ", "‚ñÜ", "‚ñá" },
  gantt = {
    -- List of thread names to display by default in the Gantt chart.
    -- GameThread, RenderThread, and RHIThread are particularly important for performance analysis.
    default_threads = {
      "GameThread",
      "RHIThread",
      "RenderThread 0",
    },
  },
  -- Syntax highlighting settings
  highlights = {
    enabled = true,
    groups = {
      -- You can override default highlight rules or add new ones here.
    },
  },
}
```

## ‚ö° Usage

Run these commands inside your Unreal Engine project directory.

```vim
:ULG start      " Start tailing the UE log (+ build log).
:ULG start!     " Open a file picker to select a UE log file to tail.
:ULG stop       " Stop tailing logs (keeps the windows open).
:ULG close      " Close all log windows.
:ULG crash      " Open the file picker to select a crash log.
:ULG trace      " Open the most recent .utrace file in Saved/Profiling. Falls back to trace! if not found.
:ULG trace!     " Open a .utrace picker to analyze and display information (can be slow on the first run as it generates a cache).
:ULG remote     " Send a remote command to Unreal Engine using a function from the Kismet library.
```
### In the Log Window
*   Press `P` (by default) to open an input prompt for sending remote commands to the Unreal Editor. Completion for configured commands is available.

To close a log window, focus it and press `q` (by default), or run `:ULG close`.

## ü§ù Integrations

### lualine.nvim

Integrate with [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) to display the `ULG.nvim` monitoring status in your statusline.

<div align=center><img width="60%" alt="lualine integration" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taku25/ULG.nvim/main/assets/lualine.png" /></div>

Add the following to your `lualine` configuration:

```lua
-- lualine.lua

-- Define the lualine component
  local ulg_component = {
    -- 1. Ë°®Á§∫„Åô„ÇãÂÜÖÂÆπ„ÇíËøî„ÅôÈñ¢Êï∞
    function()
      if require("lazy.core.config").plugins["ULG.nvim"]._.loaded then
        local ok, view_state = pcall(require, "ULG.context.view_state")
        if not ok then return "" end


        local s = view_state.get_state("ULG")
        if s and s.is_active == true then
          return "üëÄ ULG: " .. vim.fn.fnamemodify(s.filepath, ":t")
        end
      end
      return ""
    end,
    cond = function()
      if require("lazy.core.config").plugins["ULG.nvim"]._.loaded then
        local ok, view_state = pcall(require, "ULG.context.view_state")
        if not ok then return false end
        local s = view_state.get_state("ULG")
        if s and s.is_active == true then
          return true
        end
        return false
      end
      return false
    end,
  }

-- Example lualine setup
require('lualine').setup({
  options = {
    -- ...
  },
  sections = {
    -- ...
    lualine_x = { 'diagnostics', ulg_component },
    -- ...
  }
})
```
